# Objects:

>Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object,
variables and functions take on new names.

* If a variable is part of an object, it is called a
property.

* If a function is part of an object, it is called a method.

* key in an object is a Variables and named functions,
properties and methods have a
name and a value. and can't take two keys.

* The value of a property can be a
st ring, number, Boolean, array, or
even another object.

# Document Object Model (DOM):

> specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

* The DOM is called an object model
because the model (the DOM tree) is
made of objects.

* the model when the browser open a page is called DOM.

* when we want to access an element in an DOM tree there is two ways:

1: Locate the node that represents the element you want to work with.

2: Use its text content, child elements, and attributes.
