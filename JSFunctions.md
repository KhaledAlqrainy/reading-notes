# JavaScript Function
> The part of code we use when we want to do a paticular task, its executed when something call it.

Example of the function formula :
function myFunction(p1, p2) {
  return p1 * p2;  
}

The function returns the product of p1 and p2

### JavaScript Function Syntax
* A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().

The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:

* When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)

* When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code

* Automatically (self invoked)

> You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

> Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.

> Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become local to the function.
Local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
