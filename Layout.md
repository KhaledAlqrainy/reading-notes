# CSS Layout:

> Layout is to design our webpage screen and divide the subjects into blocks and boxes.

* Block-level box : start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
of any layout.

* we can control the postion of elemnts:  

1- **Normal flow** : Every block-level element
appears on a new line, causing
each item to appear lower down
the page than the previous one.

2- **Relative Positioning** : This moves an element from the
position it would be in normal
flow, shifting it to the top, right,
bottom, or left of where it
would have been placed.

3- **Absolute positioning** : Absolutely positioned elements
move as users scroll up and
down the page.
