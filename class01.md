# The structres of the webpage

in every web page there is 3 languages we use to make this webpage look better and useable for the users

* Html : contain tags which we use to write the code that want to show it to users

* CSS : to style the code we write it in HTML.

* JavaScript : the way we ant our webpage to react with the user.

### HTMl:
>there is many tags and attributes we use in html

* Headers & Footers : The <header> and <footer>
elements can be used for:
● The main header or footer
that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the
site.
● A header or footer for an
individual <article> or
<section> within the page.

* Navigation : The <nav> element is used to
contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the
primary site navigation.

* Articles : The <article> element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.

* Sections : The <section> element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.
