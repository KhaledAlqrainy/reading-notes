# Deployment

## Vercel

> **The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the Vercel platform from the creators of Next.js. Vercel is an all-in-one platform with Global CDN supporting static & Jamstack deployment and Serverless Functions.**

## Getting started

1. _Sign up to Vercel._

2. _After signing up, you’ll arrive on the “Import Project” page. Under “From Git Repository”, choose the Git provider you use and set up an integration. (Instructions: `GitHub` / `GitLab` / `BitBucket`)._

3. _After importing, it’ll deploy your Next.js app and provide you with a deployment URL. Click “Visit” to see your app in production._

## Workflow to use. Vercel supports

> what we call the DPS workflow: `Develop`, `Preview`, and `Ship`.
**Develop**: Write code in Next.js. Keep the development server running and take advantage of React Fast Refresh.

**Preview**: Every time you push changes to a branch on GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket, Vercel automatically creates a new deployment with a unique URL. You can view them on GitHub when you open a pull request, or under “Preview Deployments” on your project page on Vercel.

**Ship**: When you’re ready to ship, merge the pull request to your default branch (e.g. main). Vercel will automatically create a production deployment.
