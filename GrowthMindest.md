# About Growth Mindest
Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). 
This is because they worry less about looking smart and they put more energy into learning.
### here are a picture shows the difference between Fixed and Growth mindest:

__In my perspective there is many things you can do to keep your self growth mindest__
* Always looking for answers and never stop searching, because it will allow you to learn new things everyday and grow more as compared to most people.
* I you fail in something take it as a good point to learn from your mistakes, no one is clear of mistakes but the cleaver one who learn from his mistakes.
* Don't you ever stop believing in yourself.
