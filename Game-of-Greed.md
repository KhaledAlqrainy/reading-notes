# How to use the Random Module in Python

> The random module provides access to functions that support many operations. Perhaps the most important thing is that it allows you to generate random numbers.

* The Random module contains some very useful functions such like:

**Randint** : If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function Randint accepts two parameters: a lowest and a highest number.

**Random**: If you want a larger number, you can multiply it.

**Choice** : Generate a random value from the sequence sequence.

**Shuffle** : shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.

**Randrange** : Generate a randomly selected element from range(start, stop, step)
