* The JavaScript console will tell you when there is a problem with a script,
where to look for the problem, and what kind of issue it seems to be.

* The JavaScript console is just one of severa l developer tools that are
found in all modern browsers.

* The console will show you when there is an
error in your JavaScript. It also displays the line
where it became a problem for the interpreter.

* You can create a breakpoint
in your code using just the
debugger keyword. When the
developer tools are open, this
will automatically create a
breakpoint.
