Pain vs Suffering

- Sure there is a huge difference between pain and suffer, like the famous phrase that say " No Pain No Gain"  the greater the growth, the greater the pain. But pain in the service of growth is a good thing.

- While suffering is pain with no success or goals, it just pain with no good outcome !

 

 

Big O Notation
- Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm.

- O(1) : describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

- O(N) : describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

- O(N²) : represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

- O(2^N) : denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.

- Logarithms " O(log N) ": The iterative halving of data sets described in the binary search example produces a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase.

 

Names and Values in Python

- There’s no rule that says a value can only have one name in Python, many names can refer to one value, if two names refer to the same value, this doesn’t magically link the two names.

- Important to note is that Python has no mechanism for making a name refer to another name.

- Not all values in Python are mutable. Numbers, strings, and tuples are all immutable. There is no operation on any of these values that can change them in place. All you can do is make new object from old objects.
