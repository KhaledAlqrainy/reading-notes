# Project Ideas

* I feel like with the benefit of API that we learned in this course I can be more creative and productive in the project.

* I have an Idea about building a website about the movies geeks and gave them an an index with all the most known movies and create a list for each movies best quotes, I can get the quotes from an API.

* Also ther is an idea of building a football related site that present all the information about a specific leagues and keep updating it with the fixtures results each week.
