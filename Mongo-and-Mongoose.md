# Mongo and Mongoose

| SQL | NoSQL  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)      |  NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.       |
| SQL databases are table based databases   | NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases        |
| SQL databases have predefined schema   | NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.        |
| SQL databases are vertically scalable   | NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.         |
| SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment    | NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries.        |


### What does SQL stand for?

* Structured Query Language

### What is a relational database?

*  a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another

### What type of structure does a relational database work with?

* Relational databases rely on tables, columns, rows, or schemas to organize and retrieve data. In contrast, NoSQL databases do not rely on these structures and use more flexible data models

### What is a ‘schema’?

*  is the organization or structure for a database 

### What is a NoSQL database?

*  a type of database that stores and retrieves data without needing to define its structure first

### How does it work?

* To define NoSQL, it is helpful to start by describing SQL, which is a query language used by RDBMS. 

### What is inside of a Mongo database?

* hold one or more collections of documents. 

### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

* SQL Database is more suited for businesses and industries that deal with structured and Relational data. It is great for websites with high traffic and facilitates a high-performing query engine. Data insertions, specialized web functions, quick processing, and robust reliability are some of the best features offered by SQL Databases. 

### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

* that there are many types of NoSQL systems, and there is little uniformity among them.

* the severity of the problem depends on database server support and the quality of application code. In some cases, this issue might be very serious.
